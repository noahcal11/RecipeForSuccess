# RecipeForSuccess
## Project Description
Recipe for Success is an all-use kitchen app for both new and experienced chefs. The app has a large database of recipes searchable by time, difficulty, cuisine, and more. Users can track their skills in different culinary techniques and level up as they complete recipes involving those skills.

Within recipes, keywords are linked to a definition or video so users can quickly understand unfamiliar terms. The experience will be both accepting to new chefs without being tedious or patronizing for more experienced chefs.

## How to contribute
Each team member will have their own fork of the repository to complete their work. Everyone will work within their own fork on their stories and submit a pull request when completed. To remain updated, users open their forked repo on GitHub web, click fetch upstream to pull chages from the original repo, and go to GitHub Desktop and fetch & pull to update. As the owner of the repository, Noah C. will create a branch rather than a fork.
